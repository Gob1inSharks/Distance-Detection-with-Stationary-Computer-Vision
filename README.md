# Distance Detection with Stationary Computer Vision: Pure Visual Technology made for Machine-to-Man Communication 

## Abstract

With more advancements in robotics, efficient communication through computer vision has become a subject of interest. The goal of this project is to develop an accurate, low-cost, low energy model for locating multiple objects through cameras paired with computer vision. Existing approaches for distance detection focus mainly on visible light, ultrasonics, infrared, or microwave lasers, which are either expensive, not accurate, or close ranged. Other approaches focus on highly trained neural network systems that require tremendous amounts of data and energy. The method depicted here uses two aligned cameras with object detection, creating a more accessible approach that relies less on the quality of the device and/or the trained computer vision model. Using Google’s Mediapipe for computer vision and two cameras, this method managed to achieve high success rates within three (two currently finished) tests. It is theorized that this technology could be used for street infrastructure or other line-like places. In addition, this technology was combined with robotic and other computer vision technology and tested, proving it to be a good, efficient component in robotic systems.

## Introduction 

Devices with significant vision computing power are necessary for more efficient autonomous systems. Many uprising, revolutionary robotic systems absolutely depend on complex systems of computer vision and location, such as automatic delivery systems. It is vital for these models to be perfected and therefore it is valuable to develop powerful camera detection models. However, it is difficult to extract 3-dimensional data from purely visual cameras.  

Computer stereo vision that uses parallax greatly is used massively to do this very well (Fan 2012). However, it is expensive and requires both cameras to be absolutely synchronized. … 

The techniques above are either expensive or close ranged, which isn’t viable for street and other types of infrastructure.
