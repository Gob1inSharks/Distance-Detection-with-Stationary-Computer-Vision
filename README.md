# Distance Detection with Stationary Computer Vision: Pure Visual Technology made for Machine-to-Man Communication 

## Abstract

With more advancements in robotics, efficient communication through computer vision has become a subject of interest. The goal of this project is to develop an accurate, low-cost, low energy model for locating multiple objects through cameras paired with computer vision. Existing approaches for distance detection focuses mainly on visible light, ultrasonics, infrared, or microwave lasers, which are either expensive, not accurate, or close ranged. Other approaches focus on highly trained neural network systems that require tremendous amounts of data and energy. Using Googleâ€™s mediapipe for computer vision and two cameras, this method managed to achieve high success rates within three (two currently finished) tests. It is theorized that this technology could be used for street infrastructure or other line-like places.
