# Distance Detection with Stationary Computer Vision: Pure Visual Technology made for Machine-to-Man Communication 

## Abstract

With more advancements in robotics, efficient man-to-machine communication through computer vision has become a subject of interest. 

The goal of this project is to develop a high-accuracy, low-cost model for tracking the distance between two cameras and multiple objects. Existing approaches for distance detection focuses mainly on visible light, infrared, or microwave lasers, which are either expensive, not accurate, or close ranged. Other approaches focus on highly trained neural network systems that require tremedous amounts of data and energy. 

This model uses two cameras paired with computer vision to detection the distance between objects.

The model uses mediapipe's object detection as a backend and 

Despite only using the visual aspect of the two cameras, it managed to achieve an accuracy of 

This is
